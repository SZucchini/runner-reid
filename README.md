# Runner re-identification from single-view running video in the open-world setting
This repository contains the official implementation of "[Runner re-identification from single-view running video in the open-world setting.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-024-18881-x)" The code supports the methods and experiments presented in the paper. [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11700)

## Overview
This repository contains the following:
- Training code for GRUAE and HHCL with runner dataset.
- Evaluation code for GRUAE and HHCL with runner dataset.
- Trained weights for GRUAE and HHCL with runner dataset.
- Feature vectors for evaluation.
- Limited image dataset for evaluation.

This repository does not contain the following:
- Full dataset used in the paper (because of privacy issues).

From above reasons, you can not reproduce the results in the paper from scratch. However, you can reproduce the results in the paper using evaluation script and pre-calculated features.
